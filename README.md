# Parsing as Sequence labeling 
In our work, we have adopted the approach outlined by [Vilares et al.](https://github.com/aghie/parsing-as-pretraining), utilizing their code as a foundation. Additionally, it is pertinent to acknowledge the contributions of [Strzyz et al](https://github.com/mstrise/dep2label). for their influential work in the field. Our methodology also aligns with the findings presented in our research article available on [MDPI] (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/7/4225), which further substantiates our approach.
